# Genetic-Algorithm
### Without application of any framework.
  
***Introduction***

Genetic algorithm is employed to minimise the onjective function within the given bounds of variables.



***Methodology***

***Everything is from scratch without application of any framework.***

Genetic Algorith (GA) can only be employed to maximise any function. By modifying the 
objective function we can use GA to minimise the function. The same is employed in this 
program.
